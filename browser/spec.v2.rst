:Description: How dynamic languages integrate with Silverlight

.. contents::
 
Background
----------
Dynamic languages were first shown working in Silverlight 1.1 Alpha as part of
the Silverlight platform; writing ``<x:Code source="app.py" />`` in XAML
caused Silverlight to download app.py, and then called a special hook in the
DLR which ran the code contained in app.py. Developers would just edit their
script files and refresh the browser to see any updates; staying true to the
typical browser-development workflow. Silverlight 1.1 Alpha did not have a
concept of a XAP file, though it was always planned to have the XAP file
option for deployment. However, as Silverlight 1.1 got closer to shipping
(and was rebranded Silverlight 2), the XAP file became an absolute requirement
for applications. Instead of many JavaScript or XAML files, the XAP file
simplified Silverlight's startup dependencies into one compressed package.
Coupled with Silverlight 2 moving to a code-first model and the dynamic
languages moving outside the Silverlight platform to continue shipping every
couple months, a new solution was needed to make dynamic-language-development
work as expected.

Silverlight 2 applications written with a dynamic language require the
developer to run Chiron.exe to get the edit-refresh development experience.
Chiron.exe is a basic development-time-only web-server which translates all 
\*.xap requests into creating a valid XAP file out of the * folder, injecting
the language's required binaries and AppManifest.xaml as needed. So given an
app directory, Silverlight can be pointed at app.xap, and with Chiron.exe
running it serves the app.xap file as needed. This allows the developer to
edit their code, save the files, and then refresh the web browser to see the
updated application; Chiron.exe will generate a new XAP on every request.
Since this only happens in memory, Chiron.exe can also write the XAP file to
disk for deploying on a real web-server, like Apache or IIS.

Since Chiron.exe was introduced, there has been some confusion around how to
develop DLR-based Silverlight applications. Chiron.exe's role is so strange to
people who use dynamic languages, false information has propagated about what
it really does; most notably that Chiron.exe actually performs the compilation
and is required for deployment. 

The `MIX Online Labs <http://visitmix.com/labs>`_ team recently released a 
prototype of this very thing, called 
`Gestalt <http://visitmix.com/labs/gestalt>`_. This write-up aims to build upon
their prototype's functionality and merge it into the DLR's existing
Silverlight integration. In the future the Gestalt team will use this new
implementation to build Silverlight application highlighting the benefits of
dynamic languages in the browser.

Purpose
-------
This document will detail the changes to the existing
``Microsoft.Scripting.Silverlight.dll`` to remove the need for Chiron.exe to
simply achieve an acceptable development mode, make the development model more
familiar to browser developers and bring out the "just-text" benefits of 
dynamic languages. 

Making the default close to how browser-JavaScript development works makes 
Ruby or Python that much more familiar in the browser. This will also remove
any obstacles to developing Silverlight applications on any operating system.
For example, current Ruby or Python developers who do not use Windows have a
more difficult time developing Silverlight applications, since they have to
install Mono to run Chiron.

These changes will introduce no breaking changes to existing DLR-based
Silverlight applications; using Chiron.exe for development and starting an
application with an app.* file or the "start" initParam will still work. These
changes provide a simpler default while preserving the original functionality. 

NOTE: throughout the document are indicators on the state of the
implementation in relation to this spec. For example, sections have an
"Implemented/Not implemented" subtitle, as well as calling out specific
details which may currently vary between spec and implementation.

Minimal HTML
------------
*Implemented!*

``Silverlight.js`` is a JavaScript API used to construct the object-tag
required to host Silverlight on a HTML page, as well as doing some 
browser/Silverlight-installation detection. ``Silverlight.js`` will be part of
the default way a Silverlight control for dynamic languages is added to a HTML
page. However, the DLR integration needs specific features over-and-above what
``Silverlight.js`` provides, so those additional features will be merged in
with ``Silverlight.js`` to form ``dlr.js`` (working title, might change).

Automatically adding a Silverlight control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By default, ``dlr.js`` does the necessary work to host Silverlight on a page,
just by including the file::

    <script type="text/javascript" src="dlr.js" /> 
 
This significantly decreases the amount of boilerplate HTML you need to host
Silverlight; from about 20 lines of HTML. This adds one hidden Silverlight
control for using DLR-based languages to only script the DOM. The XAML section
later on will show how to use Silverlight graphics. 

Customizing default settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To customize the default settings, you can do so before ``dlr.js`` is included.
Defaults are merged with any custom settings, so just provide the settings you
want to customize::

    <script type="text/javascript"> 
      if (!window.DLR) 
        window.DLR = {settings: { width: "100%", height: "100%" } };
    </script> 
    <script type="text/javascript" src="dlr.js" />
 
By default the Silverlight control will be created with these settings, which
are split between DLR-specific settings and settings passed along to 
Silverlight.js, which all are placed on the Silverlight object tag 
(default values are in **bold**):

- ``id``: **silverlightDLRObject<n>** - 
  ID that the Silverlight object-tag will have, with <n> being the current
  count of objects added by dlr.js. However, if the first control is 
  autoAdded, its ``id`` is set to ``silverlightDlrObject_DOMOnly``.
  
- ``width``: **1** - Tells Silverlight the width of the control. Minimum 
  value is "1". Passed directly to Silverlight.js. It is not zero because then
  Silverlight won't load.
 
- ``height``: **1** - Tells Silverlight the height of the control. Minimum
  value is "1". Passed directly to Silverlight.js. It is not zero because then
  Silverlight won't load.
  
- ``source``: **dlr.xap** - XAP file that Silverlight will use. 
  Passed directly to Silverlight.js.

- ``onError``: **Silverlight.default_error_handler** - Default error
  handler if an exception reaches the browser page. This is passed directly
  to Silverlight.js.
  
There are also settings that can be set directly on the DLR object:

- ``DLR.autoAdd``: **true** - DLR-specific setting to tell ``dlr.js``
  whether or not to auto-add a Silverlight control. Set this to false if you
  need finer control over when and where the control gets created.

- ``DLR.path``: **"<location varies>"** - Base path where the XAP file is
  located. The default value will vary; when using ``dlr.js`` hosted on
  ironpython.net, for example, it should be the full URI of where dlr.xap
  is located. In IronPython releases, this value will be ``""``, as it's
  assumed that ``dlr.js`` and ``dlr.xap`` will be in the same location.

`Documentation on Silverlight-specific settings <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc838217(VS.95).aspx>`_

Here are the remaining DLR-specific settings (when omitted, the **bold** value
is default). They are all passed along to Silverlight.js as ``initParams``, and
``Microsoft.Scripting.Silverligh.dll`` is responcible for determining their effect:
 
- ``reportErrors``: **errorLocation** - DLR-specific setting that provides the
  DOM-id to inject a pretty error window if an syntax or compile error occurs.

- ``debug``: ( **true** | ``false`` ) - indicates whether the DLR should
  produce debug-able code. This makes stack-traces accurate, and allows the
  Visual Studio debugger to be attached to the Silverlight process to debug 
  the script-code (place break points, step, etc). However, debug-able code
  is significantly slower optimized code, so this option should only be used
  during development.

- ``console``: ( ``true`` | **false** ) - indicates whether the DLR should display
  a HTML-based console window, allowing you to switch between all available
  languages. stdout and stderr are redirected to this console so common
  printing operations work. IMPLEMENTATION BUG: the implementation does not fully support this yet;
  only the main language's console is shown, and stdout/stderr redirection is
  not done automatically; you must do it yourself.

- start: **"app.\*"** - entry-point script; executed after inline 
  script-tags. File must be present in the application’s XAP file. Not
  suggested to use when using script-tags. See FAQ for more info.

- exceptionDetail: ( ``true`` | **false** ) - Shows the entire managed stack trace
  when an exception is raised. Useful for debugging static code called from
  non-dynamic code.

- xamlid: (no default) - Used to scope script-tags to run only in a given 
  control. See the multiple Silverlight controls section.

Disabling the "auto-add" Silverlight control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To get more control over when the first Silverlight control is instantiated,
disable the autoAdd setting::

    <script type="text/javascript"> 
      if (!window.DLR) 
        window.DLR = { autoAdd: false };
    </script> 
    <script type="text/javascript" src="dlr.js" />

When you want to add the Silverlight control::

      DLR.createObject();

The DLR.createObject method can be used regardless of autoAdd's value; it
simply adds a Silverlight control to the HTML page. By default it uses
DLR.settings, but you can pass custom settings directly to DLR.createObject to
override them::

    DLR.createObject({width: '100%', height: '100%'})

Script Tags
-----------
Once a Silverlight control is on the page, then DLR-based language code can be
placed in script tags, either inline or as an external file::

    <!-- external script --> 
    <script type="application/python" src="foo.py"></script> 
 
    <!-- inline script --> 
    <script type="application/python"> 
      import foo 
      window.Alert(foo.say_hello()) 
    </script> 
 
This implementation aims to be compliant with the HTML4 specification for
scripting in HTML pages: <http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/scripts.html>.
Any inconsistencies are called out below.

Inline scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Implemented!*

The HTML script-tag is used to embed code directly into the HTML page, and
this change allows DLR-based languages to be embedded as well. The ``type``
attribute defines the mime-type the script code should map to; all DLR-based
script code should use the ``application/`` prefix, but the following prefixes
are also allowed: ``text/`` and ``application/x-``. The actual language name
will be passed to the DLR hosting API, so the above example could have used
``application/ironpython`` and it would still work.

For languages that depend on spacing as part of the syntax, like Python,
the first non-blank line's indent should be considered the baseline for
indentation (i.e. no indentation). If a line's indent is smaller than the first 
line's indent, it should be assumed to have no indent as well. Here are some
examples of valid indentiation, using underscores to indicate what whitespace
is to be ignored::

    <!-- valid, mimics exactly what Python's syntax requires -->
    <script type="application/python">def foo():
      return "In Foo"
    </script>

	<!-- valid, everything is left-justified -->
	<script type="application/python">
	def foo():
      return "In Foo"
    </script>

    <!-- valid, treated as no indentation -->
        <script type="application/python">
    ______def foo():
    ______  return "In Foo"
    ____</script> 

	<!-- valid, treated as no indentation -->
	<script type="application/python">____def foo(): return "In Foo"</script>

	<!-- invalid, as the first-line's indent isn't the MIN indentation -->
	  <script type="application/python">
	____  def foo(): 
	____    return "In Foo"
    ____  
	____foo()
	__</script>

The inline code will be executed in the order they are defined, but before the
``start`` script is executed (if one is provided). All inline code is to be
executed in the same scope, which will allow methods defined in one scope to
be called from another::

    <script type="application/python"> 
      def foo():  
        return "In Foo" 
    </script> 
    ...
    <script type="application/python"> 
      window.Alert(foo()) 
    </script> 

If the defer attribute on the script tag is not present, its value is false.
Otherwise, the value is true (``defer="defer"`` or any other value will cause
``defer`` to be true). If provided the code is not run; but it can be used to
evaluate later::

    <script type="application/ruby" defer="defer" id="for_later"> 
      2 + 2 
    </script> 
    <script type="application/ruby"> 
      puts eval(document.for_later.innerHTML) 
    </script>

NOTE: Though the ``defer`` attribute is valid HTML 4.0, it's meaning is different
than described above; in HTML it means defer execution until the HTML has
finished parsing. However, since the Silverlight control is given control only
after the page has finished parsing, this meaning is impossible to achieve, so
the interpretation has been changed to not run at all.

EXAMPLE BUG: Most examples use ``defer='true'``, which is misleading because that
suggests that ``defer='false'`` does something different, which it doesn't. Need to
also make sure the implementation is getting this as a boolean from the HtmlBridge,
rather than checking for the true or false string.

External scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Implemented!*

To embed an external script into the HTML page, the src attribute is used to
specify the path to the script file. The path is relative to the HTML page.
The type attribute is still required, as it will be passed to the DLR hosting
API to identify the language. The code is executed just by placing the
script-tag on the page, just like inline script-tags. Each ``<script src="">``
tag is downloaded and cached in memory, building a virtual file-system of
external script code, replacing the role of the XAP file in the previous
application-model. The external code is run in its own DLR ``ScriptScope``,
allowing proper isolation between scripts. To just download and cache the file
but not run it, set ``defer="defer"``. This allows another script to "include"
it (for example, Python's ``import`` statement or Ruby's ``require`` method).
The language will load the cached contents of the requested script and run the
script as the language sees fit.
::

    <script type="application/ruby" src="foo.rb" defer="defer"></script>
    <script type="application/ruby">require 'foo'</script>

XAML
~~~~
*Implemented!*

For applications that want to use Silverlight graphics, XAML content can also
be embedded into a script- tag, either inline or as an external file. The type
attribute should be set to either ``application/xaml+xml`` or ``application/xml+xaml``. Just like DLR-language
script-tags, XAML script-tags are executed as they are encountered; can be
only downloaded ahead-of-time by setting ``defer="defer"``. If ``defer`` is
omitted, a XAML script tag creates a totally new Silverlight control just for
the XAML content, and sets the ``RootVisual`` to the inline XAML.::

    <script type="application/xaml+xml" id="xamlContent" width="100" height="100">
      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <Canvas xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/client/2007" Background="Wheat">
        <TextBlock Canvas.Left="20" FontSize="24" />
      </Canvas>
    </script>
 
NOTE: you must set width and height to see the XAML contents. width and height are
not valid script-tag attributes. If you are concerned with your HTML validating,
you can use JavaScript to set the width and height of the generated Silverlight
control.

Setting ``defer="defer"`` will require you to set the RootVisual yourself; you
can do so by setting the ``RootVisual`` to the script-tag element containing
XAML::

    from System.Windows.Application import RootVisual
	RootVisual(document.xamlContent)
    
This is the similar way that Silverlight 1.0 allowed XAML to
be embedded: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189016(VS.95).aspx

Zip files
~~~~~~~~~
*Implemented!*

The external file can be a ``*.zip`` file; this is useful for larger libraries
where it may be cumbersome to list all the script files out as script-tags.
The type attribute can be set to ``application/x-zip-compressed`` or ``application/zip``. 
The value of the src attribute will be placed on the language's path, and basically treated
as a folder. When a script file is requested from any other script, the
language will try to find it by using its path and checking for the existence
of the file. If the path contains a ``*.zip`` portion of the path, it will
continue to look inside the zip file::

    <script type="application/x-zip-compressed" src="ruby-stdlib.zip"></script>
    <script type="application/ruby">
      require 'stringio'
    </script>

The ``defer`` attribute toggles whether the zip file is placed on the path: it
defaults to false which adds it to the path, and true will not add it to the
path. When ``defer="defer"`` you can always programmatically add it to the path
using the language's path mechanisms::

    <script type="application/x-zip-compressed" src="ruby-stdlib.zip" defer="true"> 
    </script> 
    <script type="application/x-ruby"> 
      $:.unshift "ruby-stdlib.zip" 
    </script>

    <script type="application/x-zip-compressed" src="python-stdlib.zip" defer="true"> 
    </script> 
    <script type="application/x-python"> 
      import sys 
      sys.path.append "python-stdlib.zip" 
    </script>

IMPLEMENTATION BUG: "added the zip file to the path" is not implemented at the moment, so
it will always behave as ``defer="defer"``. Also, currently the filename
**without** extension is what's exposed to the filesystem, so the above examples
need to omit the ".zip" to work.

Since zip files are treated just like a folder, you can put anything inside
the ZIP file; DLLs, XAML files, text files, images, etc, and use them just
like you would if they were part of the file-system::

    <script type="application/x-zip-compressed" src="my-archive.zip"></script> 
    <script type="application/ruby"> 
      load_assembly "Foo.dll" 
      txt = File.open("my-archive.zip/foo.txt", 'r'){|f| f.read } 
    </script> 

The ``load_assembly`` method works because the zip file is placed on the path, and
it will look there for Foo.dll. When accessing other files with
relative/absolute paths, you can use the zip filename in the path to get to
files inside the zip file.


Multiple Silverlight controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Implemented!*

Browsers allow for multiple object-controls to be on a single page, so you
could have multiple Silverlight controls on the same page. This introduces an
unexpected side-effect to having Silverlight run code inside script-tags;
every Silverlight would run run every script-tag. Consider the following::

    <div id="message"></div>
    <script src="dlr.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      DLR.createObject({width: '100', height: '100'})
    </script>
    <script type="application/ruby">
      root_visual = UserControl.new
    </script>

Both Silverlight controls will get their ``RootVisual`` set, since the Ruby
script-tag is executed twice, once for each Silverlight control. To avoid
this, script-tags must be scoped to a specific Silverlight control. ``dlr.js``
instructs ``dlr.xap`` to only run un-scoped script-tags on the first control
added to a page, and only run scoped script-tags with subsequent added
controls. To “scope” a script-tag, the class attribute contains the same value
as its corresponding Silverlight control's ``xamlid`` initParam::

    <script type="text/javascript">
      DLR.createObject({xamlid: 'control1'})
    </script>
    <script type="application/python" class="control1">
      # will only run in the "control1" object
    </script>

An un-scoped script-tag is simply a script-tag without a class attribute.
These will run in a Silverlight control that does not have the xamlid
initParam set; dlr.js does this for only the first control it injects.

If you intend to not use Silverlight graphics through script-tags, or only use
them in one control, then you don't need to worry about scoping; scoping only
comes into play when you have multiple controls. If you want to use
Silverlight graphics, you can use this same strategy on script-tags containing
XAML to make sure the proper RootVisual is set.

A script-tag having a ``"*"`` class attribute will cause it to run in every
script-tag, so the first-example's behavior is still possible.

Changes to existing behavior 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Though there are no major breaking changes to any existing behavior of
existing applications, there needs to be some changes to existing features to
make this new activation-model work properly.

Previously, the "start" initParam (entry-point/start-script to the DLR
Silverlight app) is required if there is no ``app.*`` file in the XAP file. If
the "start" initParam is omitted in this condition, an error would have been
raised, complaining about not finding an ``app.*`` file.

This requirement is now completely relaxed; neither an app.* file or a "start" 
initParam is required. If no "start" script or defer=false script-tags exist
on the page; then nothing runs and no error is raised. This is relaxed because
a Silverlight application can be only inline XAML.
::

    <script type="application/python"> 
      ... 
    </script> 
    <object ...> 
      <params name="source" value="app.xap" /> 
      <params name="initParams" value="" /> <!-- no initParams value needed --> 
    </object> 
 
Though these changes are being introduced to remove the need for Chiron, it is
still a useful tool for generating XAP files on the fly. Chiron now serves
files out of the ``externalUrlPrefix`` path if it is a relative path, so
extensions can be developed locally and Chiron instantly picks them up. Also,
Chiron's XAP building features will build an appropriate XAP file depending on
whether you're using slvx files or not.

Interacting with markup
-----------------------
To make accessing the HTML and XAML easier and more like how JavaScript works,
variables pointing to them are added to the scope in which script-tags are
executed in.

HTML accessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Implemented!*

``document`` maps to ``System.Windows.Browser.HtmlPage.Document``, which is of type
``HtmlDocument``, and ``window`` maps to ``System.Windows.Browser.HtmlPage.Window``, which
is of type ``HtmlWindow``.
 
When a method is called on an ``HtmlDocument`` that does not exist, it calls
``GetElementById(methodName)``. The following examples are in Python::

    document.a_div_id 
    # same as ... 
    document.GetElementById("a_div_id") 

    document.doesnotexist # None 
 
When a method is called on an ``HtmlElement`` that does not exist, it should call
``GetProperty(methodName)``. When calling the non-existent method as a setter,
call ``SetProperty(methodName, value)``::

    document.a_div_id.innerHTML 
    # same as ... 
    document.a_div_id.GetProperty("innerHTML") 

    document.a_div_id.innerHTML = "Hi" 
    # same as ... 
    document.a_div_id.SetProperty("innerHTML", "Hi") 
 
When an indexer is used on an ``HtmlElement``, it should call
``GetAttribute(methodName)``. When setting the indexer, call
``SetAttribute(methodName, value)``::

    document.link_id['href'] 
    # same as ... 
    document.link_id.GetAttribute('href') 
 
    document.link_id['href'] = 'http://foo.com' 
    # same as ... 
    document.a_div_id.SetAttribute('href', 'http://foo.com') 

XAML accessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Implemented!*

``root_visual`` maps to ``System.Windows.Application.Current.RootVisual``, having a
base-type of ``FrameworkElement``. When a method is called that does not exist on
``root_visual``, then ``FindName(methodName)`` is called. This allows access to any
XAML elements with an ``x:Name`` value to be accessed by the ``x:Name`` value as a
method call::

    root_visual.Message.Text = "New Message" 

IMPLEMENTATION BUG: the ``root_visual`` shorthand is not implemented yet, though the ``me`` and
``xaml`` shorthands are available. So, for now, everywhere you see
``root_visual``, substitute it with either ``me`` or ``xaml``.

``load_root_visual`` is a method used to set the value of ``root_visual`` when it is
not auto-set. It is a light wrapper around ``DynamicApplication#LoadRootVisual``.
It takes the following parameters:

- ``xaml``\: Required. Can be the following types:

  - ``String``\: assumes a URI string, and loads it as XAML using
    DynamicApplication#LoadRootVisual. This will load xaml files referenced 
    by a script-tag, a file in a zip file, or in the main XAP file.

  - ``HtmlElement``\: assumes the innerHTML is XAML, and loads it using
    XamlReader.Load 

- ``element``\: Optional. Type is FrameworkElement. Only used when the xaml 
  argument is a String.

IMPLEMENTATION BUG: the ``load_root_visual`` wrapper is not implemented yet. Use
``DynamicApplication#LoadRootVisual`` directly if you need to, though XAML
script-tags are recommended.


Defaults to ``UserControl`` when not provided.
::

    load_root_visual(document.xamlContent) 
    # same as ... 
    DynamicApplication.LoadRootVisual = XamlReader.Load(document.xamlContent.innerHTML) 

Event handling from markup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Not implemented!*

HTML events can be hooked both through markup and/or code (for HTML/JavaScript
reference: <http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/scripts.html#h-18.2.3>). Events
can be hooked directly from HTML by providing the name of the event as an
attribute on an HTML element, whose value is a string of code in the default
scripting language. The code is executed when the event fires in the context
of the current HTML element::

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Script-Type" content="application/ruby" /> 
    <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="self.innerHTML = 'Clicked!'">Click Me</a> 
 
This is accomplished by scanning all HTML elements on the page for attributes
which are valid event names (see the HTML4 reference above). For each one
found, the event is hooked with a handler which evaluates the attribute’s
value in the default scripting language in the context of the current HTML
element. Not all events will be supported, as some have already fired by the
time Silverlight gets control (e.g. ``onload``).

Events can be hooked directly from XAML by providing the name of the event as
an attribute on a XAML tag, its value being the method name to use as a
callback when the event fires. The method should take two arguments: the
sender and the event_args::

    <script type="application/xaml+xml"> 
      ... 
      <TextBox Click="do_click" Text="Click Me" /> 
      ... 
    </script> 
    <script type="application/python"> 
      def do_click(sender, event_args): 
        sender.Text = "Clicked!" 
    </script> 
 
This is accomplished by scanning all XAML files embedded in script tags,
parsing the XML and looking for elements with attributes matching a set of
supported events (to be determined). When the event fires, the method name is
looked up and called if found, otherwise raises a runtime exception indicating
the method does not exist. Event hooking will not be supported in XAML files
provided in the XAP or another ZIP file, since Silverlight does not have a way
to enumerate zips.

Event handling from code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Implemented!*

From code, events on both HTML and XAML elements can be hooked via the
language's specific .NET event hookup syntax. Given the following HTML::

    <a id="cm">Click Me</a>

You can hook events on it just from Ruby::

    <script type="application/ruby"> 
      # either hook with a block 
      document.cm.events.onclick do |link, args| 
        link.innerHTML = "Clicked!" 
      end
 
      # or a method 
      def do_c(link, args) 
        link.innerHTML = "Clicked!" 
      end 
      document.cm.events.onclick.add method(:do_c) 
    </script> 

Or Python::

    <script type="application/python"> 
      def do_c(link): 
        link.innerHTML = "Clicked!" 
      document.cm.events.onclick += do_c 
    </script> 

IMPLEMENTATION BUG: currently the "events" method doesn't exist in Ruby, though events can
be directly hooked on HTML elements: ``document.cm.onclick{|s,e| }``. This presents some
issues, as attributes that don't exist turn into event hooks. This is implemented correctly
for Python.

Or any other scripting language based on the DLR. Hooking XAML events also
works::

    <script type="application/xml+xaml"> 
      ... 
      <TextBox x:Name="xcm" Text="Click Me" /> 
      ... 
    </script> 
    <script type="application/ruby"> 
      root_visual.xcm.mouse_left_button_down{|s,e| s.text = "Clicked!"} 
    </script> 

jQuery-influenced selectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Out of scope*

Though the idea of having a jQuery-like selector API for DLR languages is
attractive, it is less feasible since each language will want a different way
to specify the syntax. Also, libraries in those languages may exist (eg.
Ruby's Hpricot), so it'd be best to use those directly. This might be
addressed in a future change, or another library, but is out of scope for this
change.

Tiny XAP File
-------------
*Implemented!*

With both user scripts and larger libraries outside the main XAP file, the
main XAP only serves as a container for the AppManifest.xaml and any dynamic
language assemblies required by the application. Silverlight 3 introduced
"Transparent Silverlight Extensions", a way to package your own libraries into
a .slvx (Silverlight versioned extension) file (really just zip file) which
applications can depend on by referencing it from their AppManifest.xaml.
Using this feature all the assemblies can be removed from the XAP file, put in
a slvx file, and hosted on an internet location so other applications can
depend on it. Instead of IronPython and IronRuby releases containing the
assemblies built for Silverlight, they will just contain a dlr.xap file. This
xap file will be shared between all applications; only advanced scenarios will
need to modify the xap file. It will only containing just two files:

AppManifest.xaml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The AppManifest.xaml file just references the Microsoft.Scripting.slvx file,
and points the Silverlight application at the static entry point in
Microsoft.Scripting.Silverlight.dll (included in Microsoft.Scripting.slvx)::

    <Deployment 
     xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/client/2007/deployment" 
     xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" 
     RuntimeVersion="3.0.40624.0" 
     EntryPointAssembly="Microsoft.Scripting.Silverlight" 
     EntryPointType="Microsoft.Scripting.Silverlight.DynamicApplication"> 
     <Deployment.ExternalParts> 
       <ExtensionPart Source="http://ironpython.net/2.6/Microsoft.Scripting.slvx"/> 
     </Deployment.ExternalParts> 
    </Deployment> 

languages.config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The languages.config file lists the configuration information for DLR
languages that can be used in Silverlight. This file can be present in a
DLR-based xap today for defining configuration information for languages other
than Ruby and Python, but now this file must be present if an application
depends on the Microsoft.Scripting.slvx file. Included in this information is
the URL for each language’s slvx file::

    <Languages> 
        <Language names="IronPython;Python;py" 
                  extensions=".py" 
                  languageContext="IronPython.Runtime.PythonContext" 
                  assemblies="IronPython.dll;IronPython.Modules.dll" 
                  external="http://ironpython.net/2.6/IronPython.slvx" /> 
  
        <Language names="IronRuby;Ruby;rb" 
                  extensions=".rb" 
                  languageContext="IronRuby.Runtime.RubyContext" 
                  assemblies="IronRuby.dll;IronRuby.Libraries.dll" 
                  external="http://ironpython.net/2.6/IronRuby.slvx" /> 
    </Languages> 
  
The language node can have the following attributes:

- ``names``: ``;``-separated list of names the language can use 
- ``extensions``: ``;``-separated list of file extensions the language can use 
- ``languageContext``: language's type that inherits from LanguageContext 
- ``assemblies``: URIs to assemblies which make up the language

  - Optional: but if external is missing, then this list of assemblies is
    assumed to be in the XAP

- ``external``: SLVX file for all language assemblies

Microsoft.Scripting.slvx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Microsoft.Scripting.slvx will contain the following DLLs:

- Microsoft.Scripting.dll 
- Microsoft.Dynamic.dll 
- Microsoft.Scripting.Core.dll 
- Microsoft.Scripting.ExtensionAttribute.dll 
- Microsoft.Scripting.Silverlight.dll

When an application starts up, Silverlight downloads the
Microsoft.Scripting.slvx file, loads all the assemblies inside it, and then
kicks off the static entry point,
Microsoft.Scripting.Silverlight.DynamicApplication. During its startup logic,
it tries to load language configuration from the languages.config file; if
that fails it looks to already loaded assemblies referenced in the
AppManifest.xaml and loads the configuration info off the assemblies directly.
Because of this, XAP files must have a languages.config to download languages
on-demand. After the language configuration is loaded, the script-tags on the
HTML page are processed; for each language used, the existence of all the
language’s assemblies in the XAP file is checked, and if they are not all
found the language's external-package is downloaded, assemblies inside loaded,
and a ScriptEngine created for the language. Both the list of assemblies and
external-package URI are provided by languages.config.

If an application cannot depend on the slvx files hosted on the internet, they
can be hosted on any machine. Just change the AppManifest.xaml and
languages.config to point to the new location. If Chiron is still being used
to generate the XAP file, then the externalUrlPrefix in Chiron.exe.config is
the only setting that needs to be changed.
 
Debugging
---------

Visual Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Implemented!*

When you have debug mode turned on, it will just work as it used to. Attach
the debugger to the browser, open the script file in Visual Studio, place a
breakpoint, etc. Having the script files in the XAP does not make a difference
for debugging; it's all about the debug-able code being generated and having
the file open in VS.

Microsoft.Scripting.Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Not implemented!*

FAQ
---

The "start" script referenced in the Inline Scripts section ... what is it?
 
    The "start" script is another term for the entry-point script. By default it's
    ``app.*``, and ``*`` is used to figure out the correct language to instantiate.
    However, the user can specify the specific start-script in the initParams::
 
        <param name="initParams" value="start=myapp.py" />
 
    See the original dynamic languages in Silverlight specification for more
    information TODO add link.

Can I write offline Silverlight applications with this? 
 
    Not with Silverlight 3. Offline Silverlight applications do not allow using
    the browser DOM APIs, since they just run the Silverlight control outside the
    browser. Therefore, offline Silverlight applications cannot use <script> tag
    code. If you'd like to write a Silverlight application that runs both in the
    browser and on the desktop, you'll need to keep everything in the XAP file and
    use the "start" script as the application's entry-point. Silverlight 4
    supports HTML hosting, so future work may include a way to do this seamlessly.
